# Week-Two-Report
Before all, I apologize for delaying the weekend report.
On the second week of ParrotaiIPT 201, In this weekI have learned alot from Deep Learning.  
The key concepts that I have achieed through this week are as follows:  
  * General concept of Deep Learning through books and video 
  * Alot of Application of Deep Learning such as:  
        ~ Image Captioning  
        ~ Automation Colorization  
        ~ Object Classification & Detection  
        ~ Image Style Transfer  
        ~ Self Driving  
        ~ Drones  
        ~ Cyber-attack Prediction  
        ~ Machine Translation  
        ~ Speech Processing  
        ~ Automatic Text Generation  
        ~ Predict heart disease risk for eye scan  
        ~ Diagnosis od Skin Cancer  
Also I have learned in deep learning in practice you must do before developing your modal otherwise you will find a mistake or incorrect 
hyperparameter , so your data must break in three sections for accurate hyperparameter in the new application such as  
     * Training set.  
     * Hold-out cross validation set/Development or "dev" set  
     * Testing set  
Also I have learned why regulation reduces overfitting through three ways  
    * Early Stopping  
    * Data argumentation  
    * Model Ensembles  
    Lastly, On RNN learned about that this family of neural network for handling sequential data. It uses as the CNN due to the parameter sharing. On RNN learned about how to create model, train model, visualization and test mode.
In this section I enjoy reading, first reading through video conference I felt like a dream but it was true, I really liked it and the believer would be amazed at least once a week at least to give us the ruins of the eyes, I really have made history and I have been frustrated through video conference.  
**Big up sir, keep opening our eyes and cleanse our minds in the digital world.**
